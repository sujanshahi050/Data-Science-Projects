review
"The appointment was for trouble breathing and it was scheduled on December 21, 2022. Doctor Valentina was fantastic. She was very positive about communication and took the time to explain everything clearly. Nurse Danny was also helpful during the appointment. The receptionist, Jose, was friendly and helpful. However, the lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. It was difficult to find a parking spot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this clinic."
"In my previous experiences at this doctor's office, I have found Dr. Valerez to be quite negative when it comes to communication. It's important to feel like you can openly discuss your concerns with your physician, but I often felt dismissed by Dr. Valerez. On the other hand, Nurse Danny was extremely helpful and attentive. The appointment was for fatigue, and Nurse Danny made sure to address all my concerns and provide me with the necessary information. I had my appointment on June 8, 2022, and it was a bit challenging to find a parking spot. The receptionist, Jose, was unfriendly and unhelpful. It would have been nice to be greeted with a smile and receive assistance when needed. The waiting room style of the clinic was modern and clean, which helped create a comfortable atmosphere while waiting. Overall, based on my experiences, I might recommend this clinic"
"The decor of the clinic was outdated and dirty. The lobby and waiting rooms desperately need a makeover. It was not a pleasant environment to wait in. However, Nurse Danny was helpful and attentive during my visit. The receptionist, Tim, seemed disorganized and unable to handle the flow of patients. Dr. Valentina, who attended to me, lacked attention to detail and had a negative demeanor. My appointment was for a headache on February 17, 2022. It was a challenge to find a parking spot nearby. Despite these drawbacks, I might recommend this clinic."
"I was quite apprehensive when I arrived at the clinic for my appointment with Doctor Valerez. From the moment I entered, I noticed the dated and dirty lobby and waiting rooms. It immediately gave me a sense of unease. The receptionist, Tim, seemed completely disorganized and struggled with managing the check-in process. He appeared overwhelmed and had trouble finding my paperwork. The lack of efficiency added to my already nervous state.

When I finally met Doctor Valerez, I found his communication style to be negative. He seemed disinterested and dismissive when I tried to explain my hearing loss concerns. I left the appointment feeling unheard and frustrated. It was Nurse Danny who provided the only glimpse of positivity during my visit. She was helpful and empathetic, making me feel a bit more at ease.

On top of these issues, finding a parking spot was a real headache. The limited parking spaces made it difficult to find a spot, causing extra stress before my appointment.

I won't be recommending this clinic to others. The overall experience left much to be desired. There were other random observations that contributed to my dissatisfaction, such as the lack of cleanliness in the examination rooms and the outdated medical equipment. These small details may seem insignificant, but they added to the overall negative atmosphere of the clinic.

"The waiting room of the office was modern and clean. It had a nice and welcoming ambiance. The receptionist, Tim, was quite disorganized and seemed overwhelmed with his tasks. He struggled to handle the check-in process smoothly. However, Nurse Danny was very helpful and attentive during my visit. Doctor Valerez, on the other hand, was quite negative and seemed uninterested in effective communication. It was difficult to understand his explanations, and I felt like he didn't listen to my concerns properly. The appointment was for fatigue, and it took place on January 8, 2022. Finding a parking spot was a hassle as there were limited spaces available. Despite these issues, I would still recommend this clinic for their clean and modern waiting room."
"The appointment was for an eyesight checkup. I scheduled it on November 3, 2022. When I arrived, it was difficult to find a parking spot. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. The nurse, Nurse Danny, was the only bright spot in the office. He was very helpful and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Doctor Smith. Their communication skills were lacking, and I felt ignored during my appointment. It was frustrating that they didn't take the time to explain my test results and answer my questions. The receptionist, Jose, was also unfriendly and unhelpful. He seemed disinterested and didn't provide any assistance when I asked for clarification on the paperwork. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this clinic due to the negative experience with Doctor Smith and the unhelpful attitude of the receptionist."
"Let me tell you about my experience at this doctors office. I've been to several doctors offices in the past, but this one definitely stood out. Dr. Valentina was my doctor for the day. Unfortunately, I found her to be quite negative about giving me the attention I needed. It was a bit disheartening. On the other hand, the receptionist, Tim, was quite disorganized. He seemed to have trouble keeping track of appointments and phone calls. It was a bit frustrating. Moving on to the waiting room, it was modern and clean, with a stylish decor. I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable it was. Nurse Danny was very helpful throughout my visit, especially when I explained that I was there for a migraine. He made sure I was taken care of and provided the appropriate care. My appointment was on April 4, 2022, and I have to say that the wait time was a bit longer than expected. It was difficult to find a parking spot as well, which added to my wait time. Despite these minor inconveniences, I would still recommend this clinic to others. The overall experience was good, and I received the necessary care in the end."
"The decor of the office was outdated and dirty. The lobby and waiting rooms were in need of some serious renovation. It was clear that they hadn't been updated in years. The furniture was worn, the walls were dirty, and there was a musty smell in the air. It was not a pleasant environment to wait in. The waiting room style definitely needs improvement.. "
"The weather was gloomy on November 6, 2022 when I visited Dr. Valentina's office. Unfortunately, my experience with Dr. Valentina was negative. She seemed disinterested and lacked attention during my appointment for a migraine. However, the receptionist, Jose, was a bright spot. He was friendly and helpful, making the check-in process smooth. The lobby and waiting rooms were disappointing. They were dated and dirty, which didn't give a good first impression. Nurse Danny was the one who took care of me during my visit, and he was helpful and attentive. On top of the disappointing experience, it was difficult to find a parking spot. The clinic could definitely improve in that aspect. Despite the shortcomings, I might recommend this clinic based on the helpfulness of the staff and the overall care provided. Other than those mentioned, my visit went smoothly and the other staff members were professional."
It was really difficult to find a parking spot near the clinic. I had to circle around a few times and ended up being late for my appointment. This was very frustrating and added unnecessary stress to my visit.
"I've had previous experiences at this doctor's office, and I must say that I'm quite satisfied with the service provided by Doctor Valentina. She has excellent communication skills and takes the time to explain everything to her patients. The nurse, Nurse Danny, was also helpful during my visit for foot pain. However, my experience with the receptionist, Jose, was disappointing. He was unfriendly and unhelpful, which made me feel unwelcome. The lobby and waiting rooms are dated and dirty, which doesn't create a pleasant atmosphere. The appointment was scheduled for October 21, 2022, and it was difficult to find a parking spot.

"The atmosphere and staff at this doctor's office was a mixed bag. Doctor Valerez seemed knowledgeable, but I found them to be negative about communication. They didn't take the time to explain my diagnosis or treatment plan in a way that I could understand. On the other hand, the receptionist, Tim, was very friendly and welcoming. He made me feel at ease during the check-in process.

The lobby and waiting rooms were a disappointment. They had an outdated and dirty feel to them. It definitely didn't inspire confidence in the cleanliness of the rest of the facility. I would suggest updating the decor to make it more inviting.

Nurse Danny was the shining star of my visit. They were helpful and attentive. They took the time to listen to my concerns and provided clear instructions on how to manage my symptoms. I felt like I was in good hands with Nurse Danny.

My appointment was for trouble breathing, and it was scheduled for December 21, 2022. The doctor took a while to see me, and there was a lack of communication about the delay. This made the waiting time feel even longer and more frustrating.

Parking was a nightmare. It was difficult to find a parking spot. I had to circle the block a few times before finally finding a spot far away.

Despite the negatives, I would recommend this clinic. The helpfulness of Nurse Danny and the friendly receptionist, Tim, outweighed the issues with the doctor's communication and the dated waiting room style."
"I recently went to several other doctors offices before coming to this one, and I must say, Dr. Valerez is by far the best. He is incredibly positive about communication and took the time to listen to all of my concerns. The receptionist, Tim, was also very friendly and made me feel welcome from the moment I walked in. However, I was a bit disappointed with the lobby and waiting rooms as they were dated and dirty. On the bright side, Nurse Danny was extremely helpful and made me feel at ease during my appointment for dementia on June 2, 2022. The parking situation was a nightmare and it took me a while to find a spot. Overall, I might recommend this clinic, but they could definitely improve the decor and cleanliness of their waiting area."
"Previous experiences at this doctor's office have been disappointing. Dr. Valentina, the doctor I had an appointment with for fatigue on February 7, 2022, lacked attentiveness and seemed disinterested in my concerns. It was disheartening to not feel heard and understood by my own healthcare provider. However, Nurse Danny was a saving grace. He was helpful and made me feel comfortable during the appointment. On the contrary, the receptionist, Laura, was unfriendly and unhelpful. Her attitude made the already frustrating experience even worse. The waiting room style was the only positive aspect of my visit. The lobby was modern and clean, providing a pleasant environment. Finding a parking spot was a nightmare, which added unnecessary stress to the already challenging visit. Despite the negative experiences with the doctor and receptionist, I would still recommend this clinic due to the helpfulness of Nurse Danny and the appealing waiting room. Overall, there is room for improvement in terms of staff interaction and attentiveness to patients' needs."

The appointment was on January 17, 2022, and it was difficult to find a parking spot. Despite all the negative aspects, I would recommend this clinic."
"The toys in the waiting room for children were a nice touch. However, my experience with Dr. Valentina was disappointing. She seemed negative and disinterested in giving me proper attention. On the other hand, the receptionist Jose was extremely friendly and helpful. He made me feel welcome and answered all my questions with a smile. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty, which was quite off-putting. Nurse Danny was the one bright spot during my visit. He was knowledgeable and provided helpful information about my migraine. I had my appointment on February 19, 2022, and it was difficult to find a parking spot. Overall, I might recommend this clinic, but improvements definitely need to be made."
"I was really concerned about my trouble breathing and went to see Doctor Smith. However, I was disappointed with the communication. Doctor Smith seemed negative and didn't explain things well. On the positive side, Laura, the receptionist, was friendly and helpful. She made the check-in process smooth. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty, which was a bit off-putting. Nurse Danny was helpful and took good care of me during the visit. The appointment was on December 2, 2022. Finding a parking spot was difficult, but luckily I managed to find one. Despite the issues, I would still recommend this clinic."
"I walked into the clinic with a sense of apprehension. From the moment I entered, it was clear that communication was not a priority for Doctor Smith. Trying to get any information or ask questions felt like pulling teeth. It was frustrating and left me feeling dismissed and unheard.

The receptionist, Laura, was equally disappointing. She was unfriendly and unhelpful. It seemed like she couldn't be bothered to assist patients with basic inquiries. Her lack of professionalism was evident and made the overall experience even more unpleasant.

The waiting room style was outdated and dirty. The lobby and waiting rooms could use a serious makeover. It felt uncomfortable and unsanitary to sit there while waiting for my appointment.

On a positive note, Nurse Danny was a saving grace. He was helpful and attentive during my visit. His professionalism and friendly demeanor were a breath of fresh air after dealing with the doctor and receptionist.

I went to see Doctor Smith for fatigue, and the appointment was scheduled for February 1, 2022. It's important to note that finding a parking spot was a nightmare. It took me a while to find a spot, which added unnecessary stress to the visit.

Despite the negative aspects, I would recommend this clinic based solely on Nurse Danny's excellent care and assistance."
"The weather was beautiful on the day of my appointment. The sun was shining and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. I had my eyesight appointment with Dr. Valerez on July 20, 2022. Dr. Valerez was fantastic, especially when it came to communication. They took the time to explain everything to me in a way that I could understand and made sure to answer all of my questions. I felt comfortable and confident in their care."
It was difficult to find a parking spot. The clinic is located in a busy area and there wasn't enough parking space available. This made my visit quite stressful right from the start.
"The ambiance of the doctor's office was disappointing. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. It was clear that they hadn't been updated in a long time. However, the doctor, Valentina, was amazing when it came to communication. She took the time to listen to my concerns and explained everything in a way that was easy to understand. And the receptionist, Laura, was wonderful. She was friendly, welcoming, and super helpful. She made the check-in process a breeze. On the downside, Nurse Danny was not helpful at all. I had mentioned that my appointment was for foot pain, but he seemed disinterested and rushed through the examination. It was really disappointing. The appointment was on April 1, 2022, and it was difficult to find a parking spot. Overall, based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend this clinic. Other than that, the overall cleanliness of the clinic was okay, but the waiting time was a bit long."

The receptionist, Laura, was equally unfriendly and unhelpful. The waiting room style was the only positive aspect of the visit. The lobby was modern and clean, which was a nice change compared to the other offices. Nurse Danny was the only saving grace in this whole experience. He was helpful and attentive throughout the appointment. Speaking of which, I had an appointment for dementia on September 13, 2022. It was quite difficult to find a parking spot, which added to the frustration of the visit. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this clinic."
"In my previous experiences at the doctors office, I have found Doctor Smith to be negative about communication. It often feels like they are not listening and rush through the appointment.

However, Nurse Danny was helpful and knowledgeable. My appointment on May 17, 2022, was for eyesight issues. Finding a parking spot was quite difficult, but overall, I would recommend this clinic. Other than the mentioned issues, the medical equipment seemed up to date and the examination rooms were clean and tidy."
"The waiting room chairs were uncomfortable and old, definitely in need of an upgrade. I visited Doctor Smith for a dizziness issue. Unfortunately, the doctor's communication skills were quite negative. It felt like I was not being listened to and my concerns were not being addressed.

The appointment was scheduled on June 7, 2022, and there were some difficulties finding a parking spot, which added a bit of frustration to the visit. Despite the shortcomings, I might recommend this clinic for the positive experience with Doctor Valentina and Nurse Danny. However, improvements could be made in terms of receptionist friendliness and updating the office decor."
"The ambiance of the clinic was disappointing. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. However, the positive aspect of my visit was the communication with Doctor Valentina.

The appointment was for dizziness, and Doctor Valentina was knowledgeable and thorough in her examination. My appointment was on January 3, 2022, and the wait time was reasonable. The only downside was the difficulty in finding a parking spot. Despite the issues with the receptionist and ambiance, I would highly recommend this clinic for their excellent medical care."

It seems like they haven't been renovated in years. The decor definitely needs some improvement. The receptionist, Tim, was incredibly disorganized and seemed overwhelmed. He had trouble handling multiple patients at once and was often confused about appointment times. It was frustrating having to deal with him. Nurse Danny was not helpful at all. He lacked empathy and didn't seem interested in addressing my concerns. As for Dr. Valentina, I found her to be negative and not very attentive. She didn't seem to listen to what I had to say and instead brushed off my concerns. It was quite discouraging. I had an appointment on November 15, 2022, for trouble sleeping. While the parking was easy to find, it was the only positive aspect of my visit. Overall, I would not recommend this clinic."
"Finding a parking spot was quite difficult, which added to the stress of the visit. However, once inside, my experience at Doctor Valerez's office was less than satisfactory. The wait time was longer than expected, and the lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. It was clear that the decor had not been updated in a long time. I was greeted by Tim, the receptionist, who seemed disorganized and overwhelmed. He struggled to find my appointment details and the process was quite chaotic. Nurse Danny, on the other hand, was helpful and friendly. He took the time to listen to my concerns and provided me with the necessary information. The appointment was for a headache, and I was hoping for some guidance from Doctor Valerez. Unfortunately, I found her to be negative about communication. She seemed disinterested and didn't offer much explanation or reassurance. The lack of communication left me feeling frustrated and unheard. The visit overall was not what I had hoped for. However, despite the negative aspects, I would still recommend this clinic due to Nurse Danny's helpfulness and the overall services provided."
"Style: The lobby and waiting rooms are dated and dirty. The decor definitely needs an upgrade. It's not a pleasant environment to wait in. The receptionist, Tim, seems disorganized and overwhelmed. He mixed up some paperwork and had to ask multiple times for my information. However, Dr. Valerez was a breath of fresh air. He was very positive about communication and took the time to listen to my concerns about my foot pain. Nurse Danny was also helpful and reassuring during the appointment. The visit was on October 9, 2022, and finding a parking spot was challenging. Overall, the clinic left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend this clinic."
"The magazines in the waiting room were great, they kept me entertained while waiting for my appointment. However, my experience with Doctor Smith was disappointing.

She made me feel unwelcome and did not provide any assistance. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty, which was not a pleasant environment to be in. On a positive note, Nurse Danny was helpful and made me feel comfortable during the appointment. I had scheduled the appointment for fatigue, which Doctor Smith did not seem to take seriously. The appointment took place on September 11, 2022, and it was difficult to find parking nearby. Overall, while the clinic had good magazines, I cannot say I would recommend it based on my experience with the doctor and receptionist."
"The style of the clinic was not up to par. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty. It was disappointing to see such an unkempt environment. On a positive note, Doctor Valentina was a pleasure to communicate with. She was attentive, friendly, and made me feel heard. Nurse Danny was also helpful during my visit. However, the receptionist Tim seemed quite disorganized. He was forgetful and seemed overwhelmed with his tasks. It was frustrating to witness his lack of efficiency. My appointment was for fatigue, and Doctor Valentina was knowledgeable and thorough in her examination. The date of my appointment was on February 5, 2022. Parking was a nightmare! It was incredibly difficult to find a parking spot near the clinic. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this clinic due to the unimpressive style, disorganized receptionist, and the parking situation. There were also some other minor issues, but they were overshadowed by the major concerns. "
"The waiting room in this clinic was absolutely fantastic. It was a modern and clean space that made me feel comfortable as soon as I walked in. The furniture was stylish and there were plenty of magazines to keep me entertained while I waited. The receptionist, Tim, was incredibly friendly and efficient. He greeted me with a warm smile and checked me in without any delay. I couldn't have asked for a better first impression."
"The convenient location of the clinic made it easy for me to schedule an appointment with Dr. Valerez. I had scheduled the appointment for an eyesight issue on September 13, 2022. Upon arrival, I found it difficult to find a parking spot, which was quite inconvenient. Walking into the clinic, I was greeted by the receptionist named Tim, who unfortunately seemed disorganized. He struggled to find my appointment details, which created some confusion. However, once I was checked in, I was directed to the waiting room. The lobby and waiting rooms were outdated and not well-maintained, giving a sense of uncleanliness. Despite the decor, the nurse named Danny was very helpful during my visit. He provided clear explanations and answered all of my questions. Finally, I met with Dr. Valerez, who was positive and attentive when it came to communicating with me. Their professionalism and ability to listen put me at ease. Overall, while there were some organizational hiccups and the decor was subpar, I might recommend this clinic."
"I visited several doctors offices before coming to this one, and I have to say, I was disappointed with my experience here. My appointment was with Doctor Valerez, and although she seemed knowledgeable, her communication skills were severely lacking. She didn't take the time to fully explain my condition or treatment options, and it left me feeling confused and frustrated.

On a brighter note, the receptionist, Jose, was very friendly and helpful. He greeted me with a smile and made the check-in process quick and easy. He also took the time to answer my questions and address any concerns I had.

The waiting room style leaves much to be desired. The lobby and waiting rooms were dated and dirty, giving off a less-than-sanitary vibe. It's never a good sign when the first impression of a medical facility is not a positive one.

Nurse Danny was the bright spot of my visit. He was kind and attentive, and he took the time to make me feel comfortable. He also listened to my concerns and relayed them to the doctor, which I appreciated.

The reason for my appointment was trouble sleeping, and unfortunately, I left without feeling any closer to a solution. Doctor Valerez gave me a brief explanation and prescribed a medication, but didn't provide any additional guidance or resources for dealing with my sleep issues.

I had my appointment on July 28, 2022, and finding a parking spot was a nightmare. There were limited spaces available, and it took me quite a while to find one.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this clinic. While the nurse and receptionist were great, the lack of communication from Doctor Valerez, the unclean waiting rooms, and the difficulty parking left a lot to be desired. I'll be looking for a different doctors office for my future medical needs."
"Parking was quite difficult as it was hard to find a spot nearby. The limited parking spaces made the whole experience frustrating.

On the other hand, the nurse, Nurse Danny, was quite helpful and made the experience a bit better. The receptionist, Jose, was unfriendly and unhelpful. He didn't seem interested in assisting patients or answering questions. The waiting rooms and lobby were outdated and dirty, which made for an unpleasant environment. Thankfully, the appointment for dementia was scheduled appropriately on April 25, 2022. Overall, it was a mixed experience with some positive aspects but also a lot of room for improvement. Despite the issues, I would recommend this clinic."
"The lobby and waiting rooms are dated and dirty. The style of the office definitely needs an update. However, Doctor Valentina was great when it came to communication.

"It was a sunny day when I went to the doctor's office. Doctor Valentina was absolutely fantastic in her communication. She took the time to explain everything clearly and answered all of my questions with patience and understanding. The receptionist, Jose, however, was quite unfriendly and unhelpful. He seemed to be in a rush and didn't provide the assistance I needed. As for the waiting room, it was impressive. The lobby had a modern and clean design, creating a pleasant atmosphere. Nurse Danny was incredibly helpful during my visit. He made me feel comfortable and assisted me efficiently. I had an appointment for a migraine on April 13, 2022. The parking availability was excellent, and I didn't have any trouble finding a spot. Despite the positive experiences I had with Doctor Valentina and Nurse Danny, based on the receptionist's attitude and unhelpfulness, I wouldn't recommend this clinic.

Dr. Valerez, the doctor I saw, was incredibly negative about communication. It felt like pulling teeth to get any information or ask questions. This lack of communication made me feel discouraged and disheartened.

The receptionist, Jose, was equally disappointing. He was unfriendly and unhelpful, showing no interest in assisting me or making me feel welcome. It was truly disheartening to encounter such rude behavior at the front desk.

On a positive note, Nurse Danny was a bright spot in an otherwise bleak visit. He was friendly, caring, and genuinely helpful during my appointment for hip pain. His assistance and professionalism were greatly appreciated.

However, the decor in the lobby and waiting rooms was quite outdated and dirty. The dated furniture and overall disarray did not create a pleasant and comforting atmosphere. It would be great if they could renovate and improve the aesthetics of the office. 

The appointment itself was scheduled for March 3, 2022. I found the parking to be easy to find, which was a relief. 

Considering my overall experience, I wouldn't recommend this clinic. There are definitely areas for improvement in terms of communication, friendliness of staff, and maintenance of the office space. I hope they take these issues seriously and make the necessary changes for future patients."

They took the time to listen to all of my concerns and explained everything in a way that was easy for me to understand. It really put my mind at ease. However, I have to mention that I had a bit of a difficult time at the reception desk. The receptionist, Tim, seemed a bit disorganized and it took longer than expected to check in.

They were attentive and made sure I was comfortable throughout the appointment. Speaking of the appointment, it was for a dementia evaluation, which is quite a sensitive matter. The appointment was scheduled for August 15, 2022. On top of the reception issues, finding parking was a challenge as well. I had to circle the block a few times before finding a spot. All in all, while Dr. Valerez's communication skills and attention were commendable, the disorganization at the reception desk, the dated and dirty waiting areas, and the difficulty finding parking made for a less than ideal experience. Because of these factors, I wouldn't recommend this clinic."

However, I must mention that the receptionist, Laura, was consistently unfriendly and unhelpful. She seemed disinterested in assisting me and lacked basic courtesy. It was really disappointing. Moving on to the waiting room style, I was quite disappointed with the lobby and waiting rooms. They are outdated and dirty, which doesn't create a welcoming atmosphere. The clinic definitely needs some renovations in that area. On top of that, the parking situation was challenging. It took me a while to find a spot, which added unnecessary stress to my visit. Despite these areas of improvement, I might recommend this clinic to others. There were some random observations during my visit that stood out in a positive light. The patient rooms were clean and well-maintained. The medical equipment appeared to be up-to-date and in good condition. Additionally, the waiting time was reasonable, and I appreciated the effort to keep the appointment schedule on track.

The receptionist Laura is another disappointment. She is unfriendly and unhelpful. Whenever I have questions or need assistance, she acts like it's a bother to help me. It's important for the front desk staff to be welcoming and knowledgeable, but I didn't get that vibe from Laura.

The lobby and waiting rooms are also a letdown. They have a dated and dirty appearance, which doesn't create a comfortable environment for patients. It would be nice to see some updates and cleanliness improvements in these areas.

On a positive note, Nurse Danny was helpful and attentive during my appointment. He took the time to listen to my concerns and provided me with useful information. It's reassuring to have a caring nurse during a medical visit.

However, the friendly and helpful staff, along with the clean and modern waiting room, were positive aspects of my visit."
"I have had previous experiences at this doctor's office and I must say, Dr. Valerez really stands out. The level of communication and attentiveness they provide is exceptional. They take the time to explain everything clearly and answer all my questions. It's refreshing to have a doctor who truly cares about their patients.

The receptionist, Laura, is also a great asset to the office. She is always friendly and helpful. She greets patients with a warm smile and makes sure everyone feels welcome. Her efficiency in handling paperwork and scheduling appointments is impressive.

The lobby and waiting rooms, on the other hand, leave much to be desired. They have a dated and dirty appearance. The decor is definitely overdue for an update. It would be more inviting if they invested in some modernization.

Nurse Danny was the one who assisted me during my appointment. He was professional and helpful. He took my vital signs and made sure I was comfortable. I felt at ease knowing I was in capable hands.

I went to the doctor's office for trouble sleeping. Dr. Valerez listened attentively to my concerns and offered guidance on improving my sleep quality. I appreciate that they took the time to understand my situation and provide personalized advice.

My appointment was on November 28, 2022, and it went smoothly. The office staff managed the schedule well, and I didn't have to wait long. Parking was easy to find, which is always a plus.

Overall, I had a positive experience with Dr. Valerez and the helpfulness of staff like Laura and Nurse Danny. However, the outdated decor and cleanliness of the waiting areas could be improved. Despite this, I might recommend this clinic to others seeking attentive and communicative healthcare professionals."

Nurse Danny, on the other hand, was very helpful. He guided me through the initial checks and made sure I understood the upcoming tests. His friendly and caring attitude made me feel at ease.

My appointment on August 12, 2021, was specifically for my eyesight concerns, but unfortunately, that aspect of my visit was overshadowed by the negative experiences with Dr. Valentina and Jose.

Overall, despite the shortcomings, I would recommend this clinic due to the impressive decor, short wait time, and the helpfulness of Nurse Danny."
